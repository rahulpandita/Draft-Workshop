[FSE 2016](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/fse2016/mentorship-sessions/)

>Conferences are busy. Meeting with senior researchers is often hard because 1) they are hard to find; and 2) it is hard to start a conversation that could lead to a lasting mentoring relationship. The goal of this initiative is to resolve both issues by providing access to mentors in a low-pressure setting where the focus and intention of the interaction is mentoring.

I thanks oragnizers for the unique oppurtunity


Sumit Gulwani

Lost decade

Researchers should have a entreprenoural mindset.

Work on large impactful projects but break them into piecemeal goals.

Moving mountains with the team is easier than doing it alone.

Collaborations can sometime be distractions

Be fearless of moving from project to project

Make the best of the environment, try to get the people around you excited


Chris Parnin

If you cannot prototype a project in short time, you should rethink your strategy
